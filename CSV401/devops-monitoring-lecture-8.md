# Lecture 8: Advanced Infrastructure Monitoring Concepts and Challenges

## 1. Introduction to Advanced Infrastructure Monitoring (15 minutes) üöÄ

As systems grow in complexity, so do the challenges of monitoring them effectively. This lecture will explore advanced concepts and techniques for monitoring large-scale, distributed, and cloud-native infrastructures.

Key areas we'll cover:

- Cloud-native monitoring
- AI/ML in infrastructure monitoring
- Observability beyond traditional monitoring
- Challenges in modern infrastructure monitoring

## 2. Distributed Systems Monitoring (30 minutes) üåê

Monitoring distributed systems presents unique challenges due to their complex nature.

### 2.1 Key Concepts

### 2.2 Techniques and Tools

1. Distributed Tracing
   - OpenTelemetry
   - Jaeger
   - Zipkin

Example: Basic distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry in Python

```python
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import ConsoleSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import SimpleSpanProcessor

trace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider())
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

# Create a console exporter
console_exporter = ConsoleSpanExporter()
span_processor = SimpleSpanProcessor(console_exporter)
trace.get_tracer_provider().add_span_processor(span_processor)

# Example trace
with tracer.start_as_current_span("main"):
    # Do some work
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("sub_operation"):
        # Do some sub-operation
        pass
```

    app: prometheus-operator
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: prometheus-operator
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: prometheus-operator
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: prometheus-operator
        image: quay.io/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator:v0.50.0
        args:
        - --kubelet-service=kube-system/kubelet
        - --logtostderr=true
        - --config-reloader-image=quay.io/prometheus-operator/prometheus-config-reloader:v0.50.0
        - --prometheus-config-reloader=quay.io/prometheus-operator/prometheus-config-reloader:v0.50.0
```

# Generate sample data
X = np.random.randn(100, 2)
X[0] = [3, 3]  # Anomaly

# Train the model
clf = IsolationForest(contamination=0.1, random_state=42)
clf.fit(X)

# Predict anomalies
y_pred = clf.predict(X)
print("Anomalies:", X[y_pred == -1])

   - Service-level metrics (request rate, error rate, latency)
   - Infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, network)
   - Distributed traces visualization
   - Alerts for critical conditions

5. Simulate some anomalies and observe how they're reflected in the monitoring system
